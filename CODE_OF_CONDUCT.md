# Code of Conduct

## Introduction
The Zero.One.Two: Creative Technology Hub at Northumbria is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment for everyone, regardless of background, identity, or experience. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all participants in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.

## Our Standards
All participants are expected to:
- **Be respectful**: Treat everyone with kindness and professionalism. Disagreements are inevitable but must remain constructive.
- **Be inclusive**: Value diverse perspectives and experiences. Avoid language or behaviour that marginalises or excludes others.
- **Foster a positive environment**: Support and encourage each other. Celebrate achievements and provide constructive feedback.
- **Comply with policies**: Adhere to Northumbria University’s guidelines and the community’s ethical standards.

## Unacceptable Behaviour
Examples of unacceptable behaviour include but are not limited to:
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form.
- Offensive comments related to personal characteristics or identity.
- Threatening, disruptive, or abusive behaviour.
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Sharing inappropriate, malicious, or private content without consent.

## Reporting Incidents
If you witness or experience unacceptable behaviour, please report it to the hub administrators via [ad.zero.one.two@northumbria.ac.uk](mailto:ad.zero.one.two@northumbria.ac.uk). All reports will be handled with confidentiality and care.

## Enforcement
Participants asked to stop any unacceptable behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Serious or repeated violations may result in sanctions, including but not limited to:
- A verbal or written warning.
- Temporary or permanent exclusion from the community.
- Referral to Northumbria University for further action.
